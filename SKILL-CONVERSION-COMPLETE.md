## How to Use These Skills

### In Claude Code
Each skill activates automatically when you mention trigger phrases:

```
"Generate an implementation plan" → plan skill activates
"Create a developer persona" → persona skill activates
"Audit my React codebase" → react-audit skill activates
"Convert this plan to a backlog" → generate-backlog skill activates
```

### Workflow Examples

**Workflow 1: New Project Setup**
```
1. "Initialize a repository for my project"
   → repo-init skill runs
2. "Generate implementation plan from my objectives"
   → plan skill runs
3. "Convert the plan to an agile backlog"
   → generate-backlog skill runs (or backlog skill)
```

**Workflow 2: Code Quality Improvement**
```
1. "Audit my React codebase"
   → react-audit skill runs, generates REACT_RECOMMENDATIONS.md
2. Review critical findings
3. Fix high-priority issues
4. Iterate with skill for follow-up audits
```

**Workflow 3: Project Documentation**
```
1. "Generate a beautiful README for my project"
   → generate-readme skill runs
2. Review generated README.md
3. Update with project-specific links and badges
4. Commit to repository
```

**Workflow 4: Personal Development**
```
1. "Create a psychological profile of my work style"
   → psych-profile skill runs
2. Review findings about strengths and growth areas
3. Share with team for better collaboration
4. Use as reference for career development
```

**Workflow 5: Repository Reorganization**
```
1. "Organize my repository for better LLM navigation"
   → repo-organizer skill runs, generates plan
2. Review proposed changes
3. Say "APPLY PLAN" to execute reorganization
4. Review new REPO_MAP.md and DECISIONS.md
```

## Methodological Approach

### Individual SKILL.md Format
- **Why individual files**: Cleaner, simpler, easier to maintain and update
- **No bundled resources**: All content self-contained in SKILL.md
- **Imperative form**: All instructions use action verbs
- **Multiple phases**: Each skill has 3-5+ workflow phases
- **Quality-first**: Comprehensive checklists and validation steps
- **AI-friendly**: Clear triggers, actionable templates, specific examples

### Key Differences from Earlier Approach
- Changed from: Bundled packages with separate scripts/, references/, assets/
- Changed to: Individual SKILL.md files with complete content inline
- Benefit: Simpler structure, easier skill activation, self-contained
